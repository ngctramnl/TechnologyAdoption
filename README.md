# Deliverables
The goals are to identify factors influencing technology adoptions and recommendation behaviours among consumer households. The deliverables are to help IT product developers strategically design and position IT solutions.

# Findings
- There is no significant difference in LikelinessToAdopt between males and females. It indicates that gender may not be a strong determinant in individuals' likeliness to adopt new technology.
- There is no significant difference in LikelinessToAdopt among education-level groups. It indicates that education level may not be a strong determinant in individuals' likeliness to adopt new technology.
- Based on the regression model, the frequency of using wearable devices is positively associated with the likeliness to adopt. With each unit increased in frequency, the likeliness to adopt increased by 0.16. The perceived benefit in productivity and efficiency is the most important factor influencing the likeliness to adopt technology among consumer households.


# Implementations
1. Businessesâ€™ content and copies should focus on the productivity/efficiency the IT solutions can bring to consumers
2. Cater to the subsets group of people who use wearable devices frequently. Product developers might create IT solutions that are integrated with devices such as fitness activity trackers
